### Challenge 1: Midterm

For our Midterm, we decided to implement a website that offers feedback on lighting, temperature, and humidity conditions, as they pertain to household plants!

In order to implement this, we decided to use the Photoresistor (to measure light) and the DHT11 sensor (to measure temperature and humidity), which were both included in our starter kit.

As an extra feature, we added an LED bar graph that interacts with a button on the webpage.

Here is an image of the final breadboard circuit:
